# Sequence Recognizer
Sequence recognizer circuits are used to recognize binary strings. The input is
given with respect to clock pulses. The circuit changes it's states according
to input. These are shown in a diagram, appropriately called the state diagram.

The website takes multiple sequences as input and creates a state diagram for
the corresponding circuit which recognizes the sequence.
